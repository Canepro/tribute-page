# Tribute-Page
A tribute page dedicated to Quincy Larson made for freeCodeCamp project submission.

This page is build using plain HTML and CSS. I've also used Bootstrap to make the page responsive. There's no handwritten JavaScript or jQuery. Below is a Screenshot of the page. Any suggestion or critics are welcome. :)
